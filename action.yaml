  token:
    description: >
      Access token used to check out the Trivy repository.
      The token is required when using GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES).
      https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token can be used to obtain such a token.
      The token should be limited to read access only for public repositories.
      See more details in https://github.com/aquasecurity/setup-trivy/issues/10
    required: false
    ## ${{ github.token }} is default value for actions/checkout
    ## cf. https://github.com/actions/checkout/blob/eef61447b9ff4aafe5dcd4e0bbf5d482be7e7871/action.yml#L24
    default: ${{ github.token }}
  github-server-url:
    description: The base URL for the GitHub instance to clone aquasecurity/trivy from. Defaults to public https://github.com
    required: false
    ## Note: we explicitly set the default to public rather than the current server api (in case of private GHES)
    ## but it can optionally be set to '${{ github.server_url }}' on GHES if the repository has been mirrored (e.g., via actions/actions-sync).
    ## Ref. https://github.com/aquasecurity/setup-trivy/issues/10 and https://github.com/aquasecurity/setup-trivy/pull/16
